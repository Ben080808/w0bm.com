00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:17,179
<i>[Girl] "I'll miss you, Chihiro.</i>
<i>Your best friend, Rumi."</i>

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,242
<i>[Man] Chihiro.</i>
<i>Chihiro, we're almost there.</i>

3
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,984
<i>[Woman] This really is in</i>
<i>the middle of nowhere.</i>

4
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,788
<i>I'm gonna have to</i>
<i>go to the next town to shop.</i>

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,091
<i>We'll just have to learn to like it.</i>

6
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:36,132
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

7
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>It doesn't look so bad.</i>

8
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:50,713
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

9
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,651


10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,154
Mom! My flowers are dying.

11
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,884
I told you not to
smother them like that.

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:03,019
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

13
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,793
I finally get a bouquet, and it's
a good-bye present. That's depressing.

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,233
Daddy bought you a rose for
your birthday. Don't you remember?

15
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,295
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

16
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,137
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

17
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,838
<i>And quit whining.</i>
<i>It's fun to move to a new place.</i>

18
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,904
<i>It's an adventure.</i>

19
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,113
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,510
This can't be right.

21
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,022
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

22
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,524
<i>[Mother]</i>
<i>It's that blue one on the end.</i>

23
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:11,359
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turnoff.

24
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,864
<i>This road should get us there.</i>

25
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,264
<i>[Mother] Don't take a shortcut.</i>
<i>You always get us lost.</i>

26
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:19,304
<i>- Trust me. It's gonna work.</i>
<i>- [Chihiro] What are those stones?</i>

27
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,306
- They look like little houses.
- They're shrines.

28
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,343
Some people think
little spirits live there.

29
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:34,275
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fine. I've got four-wheel drive.

30
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,446
- Sit down, please, sweetie.

31
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,596


32
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,503
<i>- [Mother] Honey! Honey!</i>

33
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,941
- Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

34
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,070
What's that?

35
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,660
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

36
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,362
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

37
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,495
Chihiro.

38
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,506
Oh, for heaven's sake.

39
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,270
This building's not old. It's fake.

40
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,607
These stones are
just made of plaster.

41
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,514


42
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,985


43
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,989
- The wind's pulling us in.

44
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:48,993
- What is it?
- Let's go in. I want to see
what's on the other side.

45
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,723
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

46
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,493
Don't be such
a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

47
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:58,502
- Let's just take a look.
- The movers will get to
our house before we do.

48
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,301
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

49
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:05,935
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

50
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,611
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

51
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,615
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.

52
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,117
I'm not going!

53
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,420


54
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:24,394
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

55
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,523
But, Mom!

56
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,296
- Wait for me!

57
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,808
Everybody, watch your step.

58
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,937
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

59
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:15,269
What is this place?

60
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:19,181
- Oh, do you hear that?

61
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:25,723


62
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,283
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

63
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,659
Come on. Let's go check it out.

64
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,344


65
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,425
- What are those weird buildings?
<i>- I knew it.</i>

66
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:15,234
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

67
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:18,902
<i>They built them</i>
<i>everywhere in the early '90s.</i>

68
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:22,879
<i>Then the economy went bad,</i>
<i>and they all went bankrupt.</i>

69
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,848
This must be one of them.

70
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,909
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

71
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,614
Now let's go back.

72
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,680


73
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:34,953
Hey!

74
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,952


75
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,898


76
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,437
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

77
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,439
It's just the wind.

78
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,407
Oh, what a beautiful place.

79
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:53,410
We should have brought our lunch.
We could have had a picnic.

80
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,708


81
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,443
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

82
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,385
Hmm?

83
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:06,322
- Hey, you smell that?

84
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,258
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

85
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,195
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

86
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,198
Chihiro, hurry it up.

87
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,257
Wait a minute.

88
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,172


89
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:34,744
Hmm.

90
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,914
Over there.

91
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:49,162


92
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,225
This way.

93
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:58,472
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

94
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,807
Where is everybody?

95
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,949
Ah, there it is.

96
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,990
Hey, I found it!

97
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,048


98
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,060
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

99
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,463
Ahh, look at this.

100
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,839
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

101
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,674
- Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.
- Mm-mmm.

102
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,737
Anybody?

103
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,788
Don't worry, honey. We can pay the bill
when they get back.

104
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,255
Good plan. Hey, that looks great.

105
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:50,260
I wonder what this is called.

106
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,491
Oh, it's delicious. Chihiro,
you have to taste this.

107
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:58,127
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

108
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,172
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

109
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,901
He's got credit cards and cash.

110
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,966
Mmm.

111
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:12,180
- Chihiro, you have to
try this. It's so tender.
- Mm-mmm.

112
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,241
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

113
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,080
<i>- [Mother] Mmm.</i>

114
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,662


115
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,530
Come on, you guys. You can't.

116
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,160


117
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,595


118
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,501
That's weird.

119
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,561


120
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,601


121
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,113
<i>[Chihiro]</i>
<i>It's a bathhouse.</i>

122
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,818


123
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,995
There's the train.

124
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,106


125
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,540


126
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,544
- You shouldn't be here.
Get out of here now!

127
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,548
- What?
- It's almost night.

128
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,550
Leave, before it gets dark.

129
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,745


130
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,414
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

131
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:35,050
You've gotta get across the river. Go!
I'll distract them.

132
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:39,623


133
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,573
What's up with him?

134
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,083
Mom! Dad!

135
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:04,645
Come on! Quit eating.
Let's get out of here!

136
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,450


137
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,903


138
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,908


139
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,672


140
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,646


141
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,483
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

142
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,027
Mommy!

143
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,030


144
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,089


145
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,328


146
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,382
Water?

147
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,124


148
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,858
What?

149
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,130
I'm dreaming!
I'm dreaming!

150
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,407
Come on. Wake up! Wake up!

151
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,239
Wake up.

152
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,343
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

153
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,412
Away. Disappear.

154
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:50,326


155
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:57,257
I'm see-through!

156
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,304
It's just a bad dream.

157
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,102


158
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:26,889

162
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,441


163
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:43,303
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>You're thriving. Ah, yes.</i>

164
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:46,578
- Looking forward to a relaxing time.
- Quite a long journey.

165
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:50,610
<i>- [Woman] I hope they have...</i>

Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

No! No! No!

169
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:00,222
Open your mouth and eat this.

170
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,961
You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.

171

No!

172
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:11,469
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

- Chew it and swallow.

There you go. You're all better.

177
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,348
See for yourself.

178
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,530
- I'm okay.
- You see?

179
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,299
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

180
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,670
They... didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

181
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,403
You can't see them now,
but you will.

182
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,646
- Don't move.

183
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,098
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

184
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,799
My legs! I can't stand up.

185
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,808
Help! What do I do?

186
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,811
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

187
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,813


188
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:27,784
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

189
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,548
- Get up.

190
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,113


191
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,776


192
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,781
<i>- [Man] Welcome. Welcome.</i>

193
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:07,586
<i>Always nice to see you.</i>
<i>Welcome back.</i>

194
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,560
<i>- Welcome. Welcome.</i>

195
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:14,689
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You have to hold your breath</i>
<i>while we cross the bridge.</i>

196
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:20,102
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

197
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,867
<i>- [Man] Wonderful to see you.</i>

198
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>- [Woman] Nice to see you.</i>
<i>- Welcome back.</i>

199
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,101
I'm scared.

200
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,112
Now just stay calm.

201
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,081
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

202
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,618
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

203
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,086
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ahh, welcome.

204
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,089
Welcome back, Master Haku.

205
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,024
- Take a deep breath.

206
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,152
Hold it.

207
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,555


208
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:02,174
Welcome. Welcome.

209
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,045
Welcome back.
Good to see you.

210
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,107
- Hang on. Almost there.

211
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,619
Master Haku!

212
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,019
Where have you been?

213
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,218
Wha... A human?

214
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,352
Let's go!

215
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,954


216
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,331


217
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,335
Huh? Huh? Huh?

218
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,308


219
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:38,541
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

220
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,414
<i>[Man] Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,</i>
<i>it stinks up the place.</i>

221
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:44,284
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

222
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,380
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

223
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:48,891
Listen carefully to
what I tell you to do.

224
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,894
You can't stay here.
They'll find you...

225
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,953
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

226
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,022
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

227
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,329
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

228
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,860
You don't have any choice if you want
to help your parents.

229
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,929
This is what you have to do.

230
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:07,205
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

231
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,269
Don't worry.

232
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:13,215
<i>[Haku Narrating]</i>
<i>Now, when things quiet down,</i>
<i>go out through the back gate.</i>

233
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,583
<i>Go all the way down the stairs</i>
<i>until you reach the boiler room...</i>

234
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,918
<i>where they stoke the fires.</i>

235
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,050
<i>There you'll find Kamajii,</i>
<i>the boiler man.</i>

236
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,390
Kamajii?

237
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:27,124
Tell him you want to work here.

238
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:29,689
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

239
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:33,669
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

240
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,672
Yubaba. Huh?

241
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,140
You'll see. She's the witch who
rules the bathhouse.

242
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,406
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

243
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,413
but just keep asking for work.

244
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:46,848
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

245
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,409
- Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:52,422
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

247
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,187
I have to go. Don't forget, Chihiro,
I'm your friend.

248
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,160
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

249
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,663
I've known you
since you were very small.

250
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,667
Good luck, and whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

251
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,669
<i>- [Man] Master Haku.</i>

252
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,728
Calm down. I'm coming.

253
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:11,901
<i>[Man] Master Haku,</i>
<i>Yubaba wants to see you.</i>

254
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:16,003
I know. It's about
my mission, right?

255
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:29,588
There's a human someplace.
We must find him.

256
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,322
Let's go this way.

257
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,332
Wait for me.
Wait for me. Wait.

258
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,425
Come on. Everything's fine.

259
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,029

00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:44,768

264
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,282


265
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,291


266
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:57,739


267
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:01,012


268
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:09,918


269
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,985


270
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,590

00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,438

00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,157


273
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:50,757


274
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,375


275
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,124


276
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:24,463

00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,909

00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,583

00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:44,087


280
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:52,087


281
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,293


282
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,974

00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:11,037

00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,279


285
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:27,058
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

286
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,961


287
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,767
Uh, hello?

288
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,577
Uh, hello. Are you Kamajii?

289
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,140
Eh?

290
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:49,982
Huh?

291
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:54,889
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.

292
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,450
- Could you give me a job?

293
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,689


294
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:04,326
Four bath tokens at once.

295
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,768
- Come on. Get to work, you little runts.

296
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:09,533
<i>Yeah, I'm Kamajii...</i>

297
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:13,202
slave to the boiler
that heats the baths.

298
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:16,041
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

299
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:18,707
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

300
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,717
I don't need any help.

301
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,414
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

302
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:27,184
<i>and I've got all</i>
<i>the workers I need.</i>

303
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:43,001
- Oh. Sorry.

304
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,804


305
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:48,310
Wait. Just a second.

306
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,348


307
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,350
- Out of the way.

308
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,934


309
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,953


310
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:34,787


311
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,662


312
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:42,188


313
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,359


314
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,672


315
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:53,299


316
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:57,279
What should I do with this?

317
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,387
Should I leave it here?

318
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,924
Finish what you started, human.

319
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,265


320
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,520


321
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:47,530


322
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,796


323
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,805
- Hmm?

324
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,807


325
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,276


326
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,749
Hey, you runts. You wanna turn
back into soot?

327
00:28:11,822 --> 00:28:15,349
And you, back off. You can't just take
someone else's job.

328
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,827
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

329
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:23,230
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

330
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,598


331
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,830


332
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:35,311
You soot balls got a problem?
Get back to work!

333
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,110
Chow time. What's going on?

334
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,447
Are you guys fighting again?

335
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:44,248
- Where's your other bowl?

336
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:46,255
- Oh. Ahh.
- From yesterday?

337
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:49,053
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

338
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:51,151
Meal time! Take a break.

339
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:53,219


340
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:56,222


341
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,536


342
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,310
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

343
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,011
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

344
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:18,521
She said she wants to work here...

345
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,716
but I've got all the help I need.

346
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,056
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

347
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,062
I think she can handle it.

348
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,758
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

349
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:32,996
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

350
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,334
It's a good one.

351
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:39,433
If you want a job, you'll have to
make a deal with Yubaba.

352
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,910
She's the head honcho here.

353
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:45,915
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

354
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,018


355
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,949
- Can't you even manage a
"Yes, ma'am" or a "Thank you"?
- Yes, ma'am.

356
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,960
What a dope. Hurry up.

357
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,292
- Yes, ma'am.

358
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:03,162
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>your shoes or your socks.</i>

359
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:05,167
<i>- Just leave 'em.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

360
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:10,936


361
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:15,604
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.
You know, he's really sticking
his neck out for you.

362
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,410
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man.

363
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,247
Good luck.

364
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:35,726
We have to go all the way to the
top floor. That's where Yubaba lives.

365
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,393


366
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,876
<i>Get over here.</i>

367
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:58,154
- You wanna lose your nose?

368
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:07,263


369
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:11,324
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>More appetizers.</i>

370
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,336
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Not spicy enough.</i>

371
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,573
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

372
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,584
<i>Here we go.</i>

373
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:35,324
The radish spirit.

374
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:40,887


375
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:42,989
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

376
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,468
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

377
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,600


378
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:08,148


379
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,194
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

380
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,189


381
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,776
- Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

382
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,781
I don't think they're big enough.

383
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,785
Your rooms are right this way.

384
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:40,017
- Hmm. Rin?
- What?

385
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,115


386
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,387
What's that smell?

387
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,988
- It's human. You smell
just like a human.
- Oh, really?

388
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:52,229
<i>Where's it coming from, Rin?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

389
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:55,703
You're hiding something, aren't you?

390
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:58,741
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

391
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,505
Roasted... newt!

392
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:04,945
No way, frog.
I'm saving every last bite for myself.

393
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:08,007
Please, just a little bit.
Just give me a leg.

394
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:12,181
- If you wanna go up,
pull the lever on your right.

395
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:17,091
<i>[Frog]</i>
<i>Gimme, gimme, gimme.</i>
<i>How could you be so cruel?</i>

396
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,688
<i>- [Frog] Can't you share?</i>

397
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:23,699
<i>Let me suck on the tail. Please!</i>

398
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,328
- Let me...
- Mmm.

399
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,519
- Aren't you even going to knock?

400
00:35:00,596 --> 00:35:04,362
You're the most pathetic little girl
I've ever seen.

401
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,334


402
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,598


403
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,569
Well, come in.

404
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:23,050
- I said, come in.

405
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:44,029


406
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,074


407
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,841
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

408
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,111


409
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could give me a job?

410
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:21,138


411
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,806
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

412
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:29,544
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

413
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:34,885
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

414
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:38,154
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

415
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,924
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

416
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:45,398
<i>And you humans</i>
<i>always make a mess of things.</i>

417
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:50,405
<i>Like your parents, who gobbled up</i>
<i>the food of the spirits like pigs.</i>

418
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:54,773
They got what they deserved,
and you should be punished too.

419
00:36:54,844 --> 00:37:00,749
Hmm.

420
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,807
You could be a piglet.

421
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:07,185
Or, maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal?

422
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:12,123


423
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:15,186


424
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:19,701
I can see you shaking. Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

425
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,728
But I'm sure
you didn't do it on your own.

426
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:26,604
Let's thank whoever helped you.

427
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:30,839
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

428
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:35,373
- Please! Can't you give me a job?

429
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,579
- Don't start that again.
- Please, I just want to work.

430
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:42,852
Don't say that!

431
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,525
Why in world do you think
I should give you a job?

432
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,967
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled crybaby...

433
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,597
and you have no manners.

434
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:00,904
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

435
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:06,915
So there's no job for you.
Now get out. I've got
all the lazy bums I need.

436
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:12,750
- Or maybe I'll give you the most
difficult job I've got...

437
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,256
and work you until you breathe...

438
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:19,852
your very last breath.

439
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,920


440
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:25,398


441
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:28,801


442
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,738


443
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:35,072
Oh, dear,
you woke up the baby.

444
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:38,875
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

445
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,610
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

446
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:43,652
I want you to give me a job, please!

447
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,313
Quiet down! You're scaring the baby.

448
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:50,085
- Ooh! Hi, sweetie. Don't be angry.

449
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,619
- That's a good boy.

450
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:57,029
I'm not leaving
till you give me a job.

451
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,533
- Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

452
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:04,471
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

453
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:23,114


454
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,962
<i>That's your contract.</i>

455
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:32,626
Sign your name away,
and I'll put you to work.

456
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,726
If I hear one little
complaint out of you...

457
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:38,000
you'll be joining
your parents in the pigpen.

458
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:40,473
So I...
Do I sign my name here?

459
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:43,944
<i>Just sign it.</i>
<i>Do you want the job or not?</i>

460
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,279
- I can't believe I took that oath.

461
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:54,345
Give a job to anyone who asks.

462
00:39:55,958 --> 00:40:00,486
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

463
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,123
<i>Are you done yet?</i>

464
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,697
- So, your name's Chihiro.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

465
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:13,571
What a pretty name.

466
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,881
And it belongs to me now.

467
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:28,981
<i>From now on, your name is Sen.</i>
<i>You got that?</i>

468
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:31,856
<i>- Answer me, Sen!</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

469
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:36,694
<i>You called for me?</i>

470
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:40,166
<i>This girl signed a contract.</i>
<i>Set her up with a job.</i>

471
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:43,068
Right. What's your name?

472
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:46,801
What? Chih... Oh. It's Sen.

473
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,275
Okay, Sen. Follow me.

474
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:59,113
Haku, uh...

475
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:03,386
Don't talk to me,
and address me as Master Haku.

476
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:18,766


477
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:24,302
- I don't care if Yubaba
gets angry with us.
- We're not taking humans.

478
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,780
- She's already under contract.
- What?

479
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:31,047
- I promise to work very hard.
- We are not gonna
take her in our department.

480
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,145
- She'll stink up the whole place.
- We don't want her.

481
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:36,419
Three days of eating our food,
and her smell will go away.

482
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:41,828
If she doesn't work hard, roast her,
boil her, do whatever you want.

483
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:44,422
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

484
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,934
What? Don't you dump her on me.

485
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:49,835
- You said you wanted an assistant.
- That's perfect.

486
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:52,100
- Give the girl to Rin.
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

487
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:55,007
- Sen, get going.
- Right.

488
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:58,513
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku. You hear me?

489
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,346
- Have a nice day.
- Hmph.

490
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,682
Come on.

491
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,686
I can't believe you pulled it off.

492
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:17,459
- Huh?
<i>- You're such a dope.</i>
<i>I was really worried.</i>

493
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:22,266
Now, keep on your toes,
and if you need anything, ask me. Okay?

494
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,965
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

495
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,975
I don't feel so good.

496
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:35,173
So, this is our room.

497
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,844
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

498
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,148
Here's your apron. You have to
wash it yourself. Your pants.

499
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:48,026
You're so puny.

500
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,190
Way too big.

501
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:53,860
- Rin, you know Haku?
<i>- What about him?</i>

502
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:56,200
There aren't two of him
here, are there?

503
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,072
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one. Too big.

504
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:04,374
He's Yubaba's henchman.
Don't trust anything he says.

505
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:07,643


506
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:10,412
<i>- Let's see.</i>

507
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:15,890
Ah, here we go.
Wh-What's wrong with you?

508
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,086
Are you feeling okay?

509
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,186
Quiet down. What's your problem?

510
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:24,494
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

511
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,992


512
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:20,753


513
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:26,316


514
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,686
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

515
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,368


516
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,891


517
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:49,433
- My shoes are gone.

518
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:54,238
- Huh?

519
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:01,846
Thank you.

520
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:14,425


521
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,885
- Follow me.

522
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,265
We don't have much time.
If you're found here, you'll be
turned into a pig yourself.

523
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:31,804
- You must never come here
without me. Understand?

524
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,280
I understand.

525
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:38,943


526
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:58,998
Mom, Dad, are you all right?
It's me, Sen. Hey, wake up!

527
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:01,474
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

528
00:48:05,213 --> 00:48:07,477
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

529
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:10,040
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

530
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:12,518
<i>They don't remember</i>
<i>being human.</i>

531
00:48:12,587 --> 00:48:15,021
<i>So look hard. It's up to you</i>
<i>to remember which ones they are.</i>

532
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:21,385
Don't you worry, I promise
I'll get you out of here.

533
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:25,263
So just don't get any fatter
or they'll eat you!

534
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:35,439
Here are your clothes. Hide them.

535
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:42,375
- I thought they'd been thrown away.
- You'll need them to get home.

536
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:50,390
My good-bye card's still here.

537
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:57,421
Chihiro. Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

538
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,899
That's how Yubaba controls you...
by stealing your name.

539
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:02,198
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

540
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,171
While you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

541
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,232
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

542
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:13,111
If you completely forget it,
you'll never find your way home.

543
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,706
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

544
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,718
You can't remember your name?

545
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:21,187
No. But for some reason,
I remember yours.

546
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,692
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

547
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:30,754
- No.
- I put a spell on it so it'll
give you back your strength.

548
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:33,392
Just eat it.

549
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:05,255


550
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,270
Have some more. You'll be all right.

551
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,576
[Haku] I've got to go now.
I'll be back to help you soon.

552
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:30,250
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku. You're a good friend.

553
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:44,405


554
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,463
<i>Haku.</i>

555
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:52,570
<i>He's a dragon?</i>

556
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:10,154


557
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,204
Huh?

558
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,290


559
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:09,080
- Where were you, Sen?
I was really worried.
- I'm sorry.

560
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:12,149


561
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:20,231
- Out of my way.

562
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:23,294


563
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,746
<i>- Gee, Sen...</i>

564
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:35,806
haven't you ever worked
a day in your life?

565
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:38,375
- Rin and Sen, you get the big tub today.
- What?

566
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:42,651
- Hey, that's frog work.
- Orders from the top.
So quit your complaining.

567
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,905
Hello. Aren't you
getting wet out there?

568
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:13,010
<i>- [Rin] Sen, hurry up.</i>
- Coming.

569
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:15,682
I'll leave the door open for you.

570
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,810
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
<i>- Leave me alone.</i>

571
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:51,356
Those jerks. They haven't cleaned
this tub in months.

572
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:53,826


573
00:53:56,364 --> 00:54:00,061


574
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:07,202
<i>We only use this tub</i>
<i>for our really filthy guests.</i>

575
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:11,211
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

576
00:54:11,279 --> 00:54:13,975
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

577
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:17,449
Wait! Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

578
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,547
We'll have to soak it off. Get an herbal
soak token from the foreman.

579
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:25,320
A what?

580
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:29,420
- An herbal soak token.
- All right.

581
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:31,522
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

582
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:38,061
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what?

583
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:52,080
What useless scum
is sleeking around in the rain?

584
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:12,706


585
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:20,147
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

586
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,479
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

587
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,179
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

588
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:29,223
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

589
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:33,090
I'm not giving you a token.
Relax. Good morning.

590
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:37,689
- I said scrub it yourself.
- But I was told it has
to have an herbal soak.

591
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:43,704
Well, that's too bad. Mugwort bath?
Relax and enjoy it.

592
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:45,671


593
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,575
- Hmm?

594
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:56,105
Foreman speaking. Oh, yes. What?

595
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,984
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Get back here!</i>

596
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:02,249
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- [Yubaba] What's going on?

597
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:05,383
- Nothing. Everything's fine.
- We have an intruder.

598
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,090
- Is it a human?
- I'm not quite sure.
Figure it out and report back.

599
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:12,724
Wow, Sen. You got a really good one.

600
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,531
Clip this on, then let go.

601
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:19,767
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

602
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:27,538
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

603
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:40,450
- Uh, you're such a klutz.
- Yuck! What's in this water?

604
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:43,361
Dried worm salt.
It's supposed to be good for you.

605
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:47,891
And with water this murky,
you can't see all the sludge in the tub.

606
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:51,735
Yank it again when the bath
is full, it'll stop.

607
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:55,401
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll get us some breakfast.

608
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:57,467
Okay.

609
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,593
Ow!

610
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:28,236
Uh, sir.
The bath's not ready yet.

611
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:36,514
- There's so many.

612
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:42,783
- What? They're all for me?
- Uh... Uh...

613
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:45,382
Thanks, but I don't need any more.

614
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:49,928
- Uh...
- No. I only need one.

615
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:53,559


616
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:58,370


617
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:06,971
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

618
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:11,417
- And apparently,
it's an extra smelly one.
- He's headed for the bridge.

619
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:13,886


620
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:17,914
We're closed.
Go away. We're not open.

621
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:20,586
- Go! Please, go. Leave us.
<i>- There's no one here.</i>

622
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:27,696
Hmm. Something's fishy.
That doesn't seem like
a stink spirit to me.

623
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:30,169
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

624
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:34,675
<i>Just give him a bath and get him</i>
<i>out of here as fast as you can.</i>

625
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:38,678
Everybody go back to your rooms.
Back to your rooms.

626
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:42,739
<i>- Don't worry about a thing.</i>
<i>Everybody just be calm.</i>
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

627
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:46,014
- Yes, sir.
- Sen, don't mess this up.

628
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:49,420
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

629
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,425
- But-But, I...
- No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

630
00:58:52,493 --> 00:58:55,553
- You hear me?
- It's here.

631
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,030


632
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,238


633
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:08,036
Hands down. You'll insult our guest.

634
00:59:12,747 --> 00:59:15,739


635
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:20,277
Look about you, customer.
Welcome to our baths.

636
00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:25,121
Oh, it's money.

637
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:29,186
- Sen, take the nice customer's money.
- Yes, ma'am.

638
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:37,533


639
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:42,201
<i>Don't make him wait.</i>
<i>Get him to the bath.</i>

640
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:44,744
This way.

641
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,892


642
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:03,556
- Get out of my way!
- Sen!

643
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:10,633


644
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:12,639
Our food!

645
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:14,834
Open your windows, all of them!

646
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,809
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Quickly!</i>

647
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,018


648
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:33,893


649
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:55,510


650
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:00,419
What? Just a minute, sir.

651
01:01:00,488 --> 01:01:02,422


652
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:07,622
Disgusting?

653
01:01:07,695 --> 01:01:10,823
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Let's see what she'll do next.

654
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,771
Look. She wants to refill the tub.

655
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,831
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

656
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:25,737
Ow!

657
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:29,783


658
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:35,614
Hmm. Who gave her
all the bath tokens?

659
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,624
Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

660
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,155


661
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,592
Oh, no! That's our best
herbal formula!

662
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:50,588
Sen! Sen, where are you?

663
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:53,065
Over here!

664
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:56,103
Don't worry.
St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

665
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,695
You're gonna be fine.
I won't let him hurt you.

666
01:02:58,773 --> 01:03:02,539
I think he needs help. It feels like
there's a thorn in his side.

667
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,238
<i>- A thorn?</i>
- It won't come out!

668
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:09,215
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

669
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:12,150
- Get the staff down there. Step on it!
- Huh?

670
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:15,245
Right, right, right!
Get downstairs! Help her! You!

671
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,291
<i>- All of you!</i>
- Listen to me.

672
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,758
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands...

673
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:24,391
- Grab onto this rope.
- Wait!

674
01:03:33,174 --> 01:03:36,109
- Mmm. Hold on tight.
- Got it.

675
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:38,077
- Hurry up, now.
- Get in there!

676
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:40,079
Everyone get in there
and help them.

677
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:42,047
We've got it tied on!

678
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,952
Everyone, ready on my command.

679
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:49,581
And... heave!

680
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:52,091
[All]
And... heave!

681
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,593
- Heave!
- And...

682
01:03:54,662 --> 01:03:57,096
<i>- heave!</i>
- Heave!

683
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:59,598
And heave!

684
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:03,603
<i>And heave!</i>

685
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:05,696
A bicycle?

686
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:07,707
Thought so.

687
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,709
Get ready, now!

688
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:12,803
<i>- Heave!</i>
- Heave!

689
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,905
<i>Heave!</i>

690
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:20,517


691
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:31,531


692
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:34,965


693
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:39,864


694
01:04:43,944 --> 01:04:46,572
Sen! Sen, where are you?

695
01:04:56,924 --> 01:04:59,449
Well done.

696
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:06,756
Huh?

697
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:20,812
Ahh!

698
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:31,583
- Gold!
- Gold!

699
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,889
Hey, wait!
That's company property!

700
01:05:33,961 --> 01:05:35,895
<i>- Stop!</i>
- Back off!

701
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:38,659
- Our guest is still here, you idiots!

702
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:42,031


703
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,267
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

704
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,968
- Yes, ma'am.
- Open the main gates! Make way!

705
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:55,975


706
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:03,880


707
01:06:11,398 --> 01:06:13,332


708
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:20,701
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

709
01:06:20,774 --> 01:06:24,972
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

710
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:28,014
<i>- Sake's on the house tonight.</i>

711
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:31,483
<i>- But first, hand over</i>
<i>all the gold you picked up.</i>

712
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:34,953
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

713
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,460
Here.

714
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:49,025
- I swiped a dumpling for you.
- Thank you.

715
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,594
What a day. Mmm.

716
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:56,438
- Rin, have you seen Haku?
- Not Haku again.

717
01:06:57,778 --> 01:06:59,746
He just disappears sometimes.

718
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:03,715
Rumor has it he runs around
doing Yubaba's dirty work.

719
01:07:03,784 --> 01:07:06,651
- Does he really?
<i>- [Woman] Lights out, Rin.</i>

720
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,620
Fine.

721
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,474
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

722
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:38,575
<i>What'd you expect</i>
<i>after all that rain?</i>

723
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:44,988
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

724
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:58,094
Mmm.

725
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:07,271


726
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:09,782
- What's wrong?

727
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,750


728
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,003
Ah!

729
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:36,133
Hmm.
Uh-uh.

730
01:08:37,878 --> 01:08:40,210
Huh?
Ahh!

731
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:42,579
It's gold! Huh?

732
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:46,616
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

733
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:49,053
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

734
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:56,861
Ooh! Oh! More gold!

735
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,830
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

736
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:06,531
Wait. You can make gold?

737
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,067
Ahh.

738
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:13,079
Uh, gimme!

739
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:17,148
Ahh.

740
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:20,448


741
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,955
What's going on in there?

742
01:09:24,124 --> 01:09:26,251
It's way past bedtime. Come on!

743
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:29,262
-Wh...

744
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:33,198
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

745
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:35,497
<i>- And I want you to serve me.</i>
- I know that voice.

746
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,469
<i>Here, I'll pay you up front.</i>

747
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:40,405
And... I wanna take a bath too.

748
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:42,601
Why don't you wake everyone up?

749
01:09:48,248 --> 01:09:50,944
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

750
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:53,714
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

751
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,451


752
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:01,119
Which ones are you?

753
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,288
Mom, Dad!

754
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:06,663


755
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:14,432
Bad dream.

756
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,442
Rin?

757
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:23,282
Where is everybody?

758
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,820
Wow. It really is a sea.

759
01:10:33,026 --> 01:10:35,517
<i>There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.</i>

760
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:40,091
I sure hope they're doing
all right over there.

761
01:10:43,937 --> 01:10:46,497
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

762
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,371
How long was I asleep?

763
01:10:49,443 --> 01:10:51,843
- Hurry up!

764
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:54,847
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

765
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:58,942
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers if you have to.
Hurry up! He's starving!

766
01:11:00,954 --> 01:11:03,388
<i>- Hey, Sen.</i>
- Oh, Rin.

767
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:06,051
I was just coming
to wake you up. Look.

768
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:09,527
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

769
01:11:09,596 --> 01:11:12,030
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

770
01:11:17,204 --> 01:11:20,105


771
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:26,104
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

772
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:31,417
Hmm. Who is the guest?

773
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:35,421
Oh, who cares? Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

774
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:37,423
I'm going to go look for Haku.

775
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:40,517
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

776
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:42,858
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

777
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,091
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

778
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:47,065
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>Hey, wait for me!</i>

779
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:07,876
<i>Where is Haku?</i>

780
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,649
He better get here before I forget
what my parents look like.

781
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:16,423
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

782
01:12:29,309 --> 01:12:31,675
Hmm?

783
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:36,915
Haku?

784
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:47,355
It's Haku! He's back!

785
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:53,432
Are birds chasing him?

786
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:07,005
Haku! Fight 'em! Come on!

787
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,776
He's hurt!

788
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,842
<i>Haku, this way!</i>

789
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,547
Aah!

790
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:24,220


791
01:13:27,801 --> 01:13:30,201
Huh? It's just paper.

792
01:13:58,665 --> 01:14:00,997
Haku, you're bleeding.

793
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:11,610
Hold still.
Those paper things are gone now.
You're going to be all right.

794
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:14,306


795
01:14:24,558 --> 01:14:29,518
He went in that top window.
I've got to get there
before he bleeds to death!

796
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:40,631
# Welcome the rich man
He's hard for you to miss #

797
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:44,006
# His butt keeps getting bigger
so there's plenty there to kiss #

798
01:14:44,077 --> 01:14:47,638
Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.

799
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:49,648
[All]
Welcome, rich man.

800
01:14:49,716 --> 01:14:53,413
# Beg for tips
This is the time #

801
01:14:53,487 --> 01:14:56,183
<i>- # Beg for tips</i>
<i>Make yourselves a dime #</i>

802
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:01,625
Give me some dough!
Give me some tips!

803
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:05,825
I'll do anything for you!
Just give me some tips!

804
01:15:08,335 --> 01:15:11,202
- Hey, what are you doing?

805
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:14,399
- Going upstairs.
- No, you're not.

806
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:16,169
Huh? Aah! Blood!

807
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,347
Get out of the way!
Our guest is coming through here!

808
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,941
Thank you for helping me earlier.

809
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:28,988
- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

810
01:15:29,056 --> 01:15:32,355


811
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,827


812
01:15:37,898 --> 01:15:40,560


813
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,071
I don't want any, but thanks.

814
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:57,716
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

815
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:02,079


816
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:11,927
- Hey, there! Hey!
Get back! Get back now!
- Ow!

817
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:14,796
Everybody, out!

818
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:16,802
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

819
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:20,135
You'll have to excuse the little girl.
She's just a human.

820
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:25,404
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

821
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:27,538
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

822
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:30,048


823
01:16:30,117 --> 01:16:31,709


824
01:16:31,785 --> 01:16:34,447


825
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:46,198


826
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:24,134
Aah!

827
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:53,397


828
01:17:55,034 --> 01:17:56,934
Huh?

829
01:18:02,074 --> 01:18:03,974
It's Yubaba!

830
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:31,002


831
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:38,770


832
01:19:16,315 --> 01:19:18,476
<i>[Yubaba]</i>
<i>We're in a big mess.</i>

833
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:21,018
<i>I found out who</i>
<i>our rich customer is.</i>

834
01:19:21,086 --> 01:19:23,953
<i>He's a No-Face!</i>
<i>It's all your fault. You're so greedy.</i>

835
01:19:24,023 --> 01:19:28,153
<i>You attract terrible guests.</i>
<i>All right, I'm on my way.</i>

836
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:31,685
<i>Don't let him eat anyone else</i>
<i>till I get down there.</i>

837
01:19:31,764 --> 01:19:35,222
Haku is bleeding
all over the carpet.

838
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:38,236
<i>Get him out of here.</i>
<i>He'll be dead soon anyway.</i>

839
01:19:40,472 --> 01:19:41,837


840
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:46,043


841
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,386
- Ahh.

842
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:03,760
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

843
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:07,390


844
01:20:07,466 --> 01:20:11,800
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

845
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,839
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

846
01:20:14,907 --> 01:20:17,705


847
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:19,676
Go back to sleep, now.

848
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:47,632


849
01:20:49,174 --> 01:20:51,165
Ow! Let go of me!

850
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:54,804
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

851
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,611
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

852
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:01,847
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from
outside, aren't you?

853
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,616
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

854
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:06,624
Now, would you please let go of me?

855
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:09,354
You'll get sick if you go outside.

856
01:21:09,428 --> 01:21:11,362
So stay here and play with me.

857
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,955
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

858
01:21:14,033 --> 01:21:15,967
That's why I've never left this room.

859
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:18,833
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

860
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:22,806
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

861
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:25,776
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

862
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:28,836
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

863
01:21:28,914 --> 01:21:31,280
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

864
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:34,786
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

865
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,912
Please! I'll play with you later, okay?

866
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:41,153
- No, I wanna play now!

867
01:21:41,226 --> 01:21:44,992
- Germs! I've got germs, see?

868
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:46,998


869
01:21:56,175 --> 01:21:58,166
Haku!

870
01:21:58,243 --> 01:22:01,542
What are you doing? Get away!
Get back! Haku, are you okay?

871
01:22:01,613 --> 01:22:03,604
- Can you hear me?

872
01:22:03,682 --> 01:22:06,048
- Shut your mouth! Haku!

873
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:12,548
- Get back!

874
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:17,524
Stop it!

875
01:22:26,972 --> 01:22:29,270


876
01:22:31,443 --> 01:22:35,379
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

877
01:22:35,447 --> 01:22:37,381
Please don't cry. Just wait.

878
01:22:37,449 --> 01:22:40,475
Right now, or I'll start crying.

879
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,645


880
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:44,655
Don't cry! Don't cry!

881
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:47,624
What a spoiled brat!

882
01:22:47,693 --> 01:22:50,355
Shut your big mouth!

883
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:52,590
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

884
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:02,298
- Hmm. Still see-through.
- Mama?

885
01:23:02,374 --> 01:23:07,471
You pea-brain. Can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

886
01:23:14,586 --> 01:23:18,113
There, now. Your body
matches your brain.

887
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:21,455
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

888
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:26,556


889
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:38,439


890
01:23:39,511 --> 01:23:41,445
This is our little secret.

891
01:23:41,513 --> 01:23:44,311
You tell anyone else,
and I'll rip your mouth out.

892
01:23:46,051 --> 01:23:49,919
- Who are you?
- Zaneba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

893
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:53,617
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

894
01:23:53,692 --> 01:23:55,626
Now, hand him over to me.

895
01:23:55,694 --> 01:23:58,185
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

896
01:23:58,263 --> 01:24:02,097
Too bad. He stole my solid gold seal.

897
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,829
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

898
01:24:04,903 --> 01:24:07,804
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

899
01:24:07,873 --> 01:24:12,003
Huh! Do you know why he became
my sister's apprentice?

900
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:16,514
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

901
01:24:16,582 --> 01:24:20,746
<i>He's a greedy little thief.</i>
<i>There's nothing good about him.</i>

902
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:25,779
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

903
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:30,988
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

904
01:24:31,063 --> 01:24:33,998
- No, you can't!

905
01:24:40,672 --> 01:24:44,164
You idiots! What's your problem?

906
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:48,043
<i>Keep quiet. I don't want my sister</i>
<i>coming up here.</i>

907
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:56,013
Ow. A paper cut.

908
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:58,482
Haku, we're falling!

909
01:25:18,076 --> 01:25:19,976
Haku!

910
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,826


911
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:47,963


912
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,134
- What's going on here?
Sen, be careful! Stay back!
- Haku!

913
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:55,413
Are you okay? Haku!

914
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,415


915
01:25:58,483 --> 01:26:01,714
- What's wrong with you?

916
01:26:05,089 --> 01:26:07,523
This looks serious.

917
01:26:09,226 --> 01:26:12,423
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

918
01:26:12,496 --> 01:26:15,829
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

919
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:20,303
- From the inside?
- I think so.
Maybe he swallowed something.

920
01:26:20,371 --> 01:26:24,068
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

921
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:26,166
Eat it. Maybe it'll help.

922
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:30,679
Come on! Open your mouth!

923
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:33,512
Please, Haku! Eat it!

924
01:26:35,152 --> 01:26:37,086
See? It's okay.

925
01:26:37,154 --> 01:26:39,418
Medicine from the river spirit.

926
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:42,755
Open your mouth. That's it.

927
01:26:45,963 --> 01:26:48,329
Got it.

928
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:50,560
- Now swallow.

929
01:27:08,152 --> 01:27:11,178
- Sen, look there!

930
01:27:21,832 --> 01:27:25,563
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug!
Over there! Get it!

931
01:27:25,636 --> 01:27:28,469
<i>Get it!</i>
<i>Get it!</i>

932
01:27:28,539 --> 01:27:31,030


933
01:27:31,108 --> 01:27:33,008


934
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,980


935
01:27:41,819 --> 01:27:45,277
<i>[Kamajii] You killed it?</i>
<i>Those things are bad luck.</i>

936
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:47,916
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

937
01:27:47,992 --> 01:27:51,484
<i>Put your thumbs</i>
<i>and forefingers together.</i>

938
01:27:51,562 --> 01:27:55,965
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal
from Yubaba's sister.

939
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:58,968
Zaneba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

940
01:27:59,036 --> 01:28:01,732
<i>That's as powerful as it gets.</i>

941
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:05,875
Look! He's changed back.

942
01:28:05,943 --> 01:28:07,877
Help me. What do we do?

943
01:28:07,945 --> 01:28:09,936


944
01:28:10,014 --> 01:28:12,574
- Haku! Haku, wake up!

945
01:28:14,652 --> 01:28:16,711
Zaneba put a curse on the seal.

946
01:28:16,787 --> 01:28:20,587
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

947
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:32,732
That should make him
more comfortable.

948
01:28:35,473 --> 01:28:39,068
Poor Haku. He's had it
hard ever since he got here.

949
01:28:39,143 --> 01:28:43,204
He just showed up
out of nowhere, just like you did.

950
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,512
<i>But he got mixed up with Yubaba.</i>
<i>He took a job as her apprentice.</i>

951
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:50,179
<i>I warned him it was too dangerous.</i>
<i>"Just quit.</i>

952
01:28:50,254 --> 01:28:52,586
<i>Go back home, "I told him.</i>

953
01:28:52,656 --> 01:28:56,752
<i>But he said for some reason</i>
<i>he had no home to return to.</i>

954
01:28:56,827 --> 01:28:59,091
<i>Once Yubaba</i>
<i>got control over him...</i>

955
01:28:59,163 --> 01:29:02,997
<i>his face turned pale</i>
<i>and his eyes turned steely.</i>

956
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:06,298
<i>- He's never been the same.</i>

957
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:10,363
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zaneba?

958
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:14,104
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

959
01:29:14,178 --> 01:29:16,237
Can you tell me
where Zaneba lives?

960
01:29:16,313 --> 01:29:18,645
You'd go to Zaneba's?

961
01:29:18,716 --> 01:29:22,208
- It might help, but she's
one dangerous witch.
- Please?

962
01:29:22,286 --> 01:29:26,450
Haku helped me before.
Now I wanna help him.

963
01:29:26,524 --> 01:29:28,617
Hmm.

964
01:29:28,692 --> 01:29:33,891
I know how you can get there,
but you'll have to get back on your own.

965
01:29:33,964 --> 01:29:36,455
Wait here.

966
01:29:36,534 --> 01:29:41,164
Let's see, now. I know it's
around here somewhere.

967
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:44,901
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

968
01:29:46,777 --> 01:29:49,268
I guess my parents will have to wait.

969
01:29:53,484 --> 01:29:56,146
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

970
01:29:58,889 --> 01:30:01,016
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

971
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:04,424
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

972
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:07,794
I picked up some new friends. See?

973
01:30:07,865 --> 01:30:11,266
- Everyone's looking for you.
Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

974
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:15,032
The guy with all the gold
turned out to be a monster
called "No-Face."

975
01:30:15,105 --> 01:30:18,233
And he says that <i>you</i>
let him into the bathhouse.

976
01:30:20,678 --> 01:30:22,612
I did let him in.

977
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,648
Are you serious?

978
01:30:24,715 --> 01:30:26,774
Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

979
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:29,819
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

980
01:30:29,887 --> 01:30:33,516
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

981
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:38,051
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

982
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:41,325
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

983
01:30:41,398 --> 01:30:43,958
I've been saving them
for 40 years.

984
01:30:44,034 --> 01:30:47,697
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

985
01:30:47,771 --> 01:30:50,171
- Swamp Bottom?
<i>- That's where Zaneba lives.</i>

986
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,174
<i>- The sixth stop.</i>
- Sixth stop.

987
01:30:52,242 --> 01:30:55,837
Make sure you get it right.
The train used to run
in both directions...

988
01:30:55,913 --> 01:30:57,938
but these days it's a one-way ride.

989
01:30:58,015 --> 01:30:59,949
Still want to go?

990
01:31:00,017 --> 01:31:04,613
Yep. I'll walk back along the tracks.

991
01:31:04,688 --> 01:31:08,749
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

992
01:31:08,826 --> 01:31:12,762
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

993
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:15,264
What's going on?

994
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:18,130
Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

995
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:21,031


996
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:23,039


997
01:31:25,843 --> 01:31:28,641
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

998
01:31:28,712 --> 01:31:31,146
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

999
01:31:31,215 --> 01:31:33,877


1000
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:42,125
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

1001
01:31:42,192 --> 01:31:44,422


1002
01:31:44,495 --> 01:31:46,486
<i>[Yubaba]</i>
<i>There's no need to get upset.</i>

1003
01:31:46,563 --> 01:31:50,158
<i>- I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.</i>

1004
01:31:50,234 --> 01:31:52,429
<i>Where is Sen? I want Sen!</i>

1005
01:31:52,503 --> 01:31:54,403
Hurry! This way!

1006
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,309
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

1007
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:08,249
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

1008
01:32:08,318 --> 01:32:12,220
- He's destroying everything.
It's costing us a fortune.

1009
01:32:12,289 --> 01:32:16,248
So suck up to him and get every last
speck of gold he's...

1010
01:32:16,326 --> 01:32:18,260


1011
01:32:18,328 --> 01:32:21,764
Ew! What's that dirty mouse doing here?

1012
01:32:21,832 --> 01:32:25,290
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

1013
01:32:25,369 --> 01:32:29,863
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

1014
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,866
Here's Sen.

1015
01:32:33,944 --> 01:32:37,175
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

1016
01:32:37,247 --> 01:32:40,182
- You wanna take her place? Hmph!
- Huh?

1017
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:02,864
Try this. It's delicious.

1018
01:33:04,808 --> 01:33:08,972
Want some gold? I'm not giving it
to anybody else.

1019
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:16,110
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

1020
01:33:16,186 --> 01:33:18,518
Just name it.

1021
01:33:18,589 --> 01:33:20,682
I would like to leave, sir.

1022
01:33:20,758 --> 01:33:23,249
I have someplace
I need to go to right away, please.

1023
01:33:25,362 --> 01:33:28,092
You should go back
to where you came from.

1024
01:33:28,165 --> 01:33:32,795
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

1025
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,101
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

1026
01:33:37,508 --> 01:33:40,238
No. No!

1027
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:43,040
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

1028
01:33:45,215 --> 01:33:47,274
What is it that you want?

1029
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:50,684
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

1030
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:53,946
Take the gold. Take it!

1031
01:33:54,024 --> 01:33:56,618
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

1032
01:33:56,693 --> 01:33:58,888
- Ooh! Huh?

1033
01:34:00,831 --> 01:34:03,095
- Huh.
- Ow.

1034
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:05,567


1035
01:34:05,636 --> 01:34:08,571
If you want to eat me,
eat this first.

1036
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,403
I was saving this for my parents...

1037
01:34:11,475 --> 01:34:14,239
but I think you'd better have it.

1038
01:34:14,311 --> 01:34:17,747


1039
01:34:26,957 --> 01:34:28,857


1040
01:34:34,498 --> 01:34:37,558
- Sen!

1041
01:34:37,634 --> 01:34:40,034
Sen, what did you do to me?

1042
01:34:42,306 --> 01:34:44,240
Aah!

1043
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:52,574


1044
01:34:55,853 --> 01:34:58,253
Enough! I don't care if he's rich!

1045
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:01,980
This nonsense has gotta stop!

1046
01:35:14,504 --> 01:35:16,438
<i>[Sen]</i>
<i>No-Face!</i>

1047
01:35:16,506 --> 01:35:18,940
Over here!

1048
01:35:20,143 --> 01:35:22,611


1049
01:35:26,383 --> 01:35:28,283
Run for your life!

1050
01:35:32,489 --> 01:35:34,389


1051
01:35:45,102 --> 01:35:47,400


1052
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:49,405


1053
01:35:54,444 --> 01:35:57,106


1054
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,648
Now, that's an esophagus!

1055
01:35:59,716 --> 01:36:02,014


1056
01:36:02,085 --> 01:36:04,986
I'll get you for this, Sen!

1057
01:36:07,224 --> 01:36:09,215
Duck!

1058
01:36:16,733 --> 01:36:19,133


1059
01:36:19,202 --> 01:36:21,102
Excuse me.

1060
01:36:22,306 --> 01:36:24,240
Sen, this way!

1061
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:42,590
Hey, over here!

1062
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:44,593
Sen, don't call him over!

1063
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:51,133
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

1064
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:53,135
He needs to get out of there.

1065
01:36:53,203 --> 01:36:55,797
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

1066
01:36:55,872 --> 01:37:00,104
You don't know? Great.
Now he's following us.

1067
01:37:00,177 --> 01:37:02,111
<i>[Sen]</i>
<i>He won't hurt us.</i>

1068
01:37:03,447 --> 01:37:05,347


1069
01:37:14,024 --> 01:37:16,788
Hmm?

1070
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,658
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

1071
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,857
The station's just down the tracks.

1072
01:37:21,932 --> 01:37:23,866
Thanks, Rin.

1073
01:37:23,934 --> 01:37:27,870
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

1074
01:37:30,874 --> 01:37:36,005
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

1075
01:37:44,187 --> 01:37:48,283
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

1076
01:37:51,628 --> 01:37:54,188
There's the station.

1077
01:38:04,307 --> 01:38:06,298
Here comes the train. Come on.

1078
01:38:28,965 --> 01:38:32,662
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

1079
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,272
Huh?

1080
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:41,867
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

1081
01:38:41,945 --> 01:38:44,379
He'd like to come too, please.

1082
01:39:21,218 --> 01:39:23,448
Uh... Uh...

1083
01:39:24,821 --> 01:39:28,416
Sit here. Behave yourself, okay?

1084
01:39:58,021 --> 01:40:00,489


1085
01:41:11,595 --> 01:41:15,725


1086
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,741
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

1087
01:41:34,517 --> 01:41:38,783
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fine. Where is Sen?

1088
01:41:38,855 --> 01:41:41,756
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

1089
01:41:41,825 --> 01:41:44,885
You blacked out, remember?

1090
01:41:44,961 --> 01:41:47,759
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

1091
01:41:47,831 --> 01:41:50,891
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

1092
01:41:50,967 --> 01:41:53,162
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

1093
01:41:53,236 --> 01:41:55,170
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

1094
01:41:55,238 --> 01:41:59,231
Pure love. It broke Zaneba's spell.

1095
01:41:59,309 --> 01:42:02,301
Sen left to return the golden seal.

1096
01:42:02,379 --> 01:42:04,574
She did it to save you.

1097
01:42:05,648 --> 01:42:09,015
<i>[Yubaba]</i>
<i>This gold doesn't even come close...</i>

1098
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:12,520
<i>to covering the damage</i>
<i>that stupid No-Face caused.</i>

1099
01:42:12,588 --> 01:42:15,421
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

1100
01:42:15,491 --> 01:42:19,689
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one
that saved us from No-Face.
- Yes, yes.

1101
01:42:19,762 --> 01:42:23,528
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

1102
01:42:23,599 --> 01:42:26,159
And now she's run away from here.

1103
01:42:26,235 --> 01:42:28,601
She's even abandoned
her own parents!

1104
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:31,868
<i>- Those pigs must be ready</i>
<i>to eat by now.</i>

1105
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:35,706
<i>- Turn them into bacon.</i>
- Wait a minute.

1106
01:42:35,778 --> 01:42:37,712
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

1107
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:41,978
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

1108
01:42:42,051 --> 01:42:45,487
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

1109
01:42:45,554 --> 01:42:48,921
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

1110
01:42:48,991 --> 01:42:51,391
Since when do you talk
that way to your master?

1111
01:42:56,899 --> 01:42:58,833


1112
01:43:00,436 --> 01:43:02,927
Huh.

1113
01:43:16,018 --> 01:43:17,952


1114
01:43:33,702 --> 01:43:35,636


1115
01:43:43,178 --> 01:43:45,408
My baby!

1116
01:43:47,316 --> 01:43:49,876
No!

1117
01:43:49,952 --> 01:43:51,715


1118
01:43:51,787 --> 01:43:53,721
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

1119
01:43:53,789 --> 01:43:56,815
Where's my baby?

1120
01:43:56,892 --> 01:43:59,827
Where are you, sweetie?

1121
01:44:01,063 --> 01:44:03,964
Come out! Please, come out!

1122
01:44:04,032 --> 01:44:05,932
Where are you?

1123
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:12,398
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

1124
01:44:15,978 --> 01:44:18,208
You!

1125
01:44:20,783 --> 01:44:25,277
Where is he?

1126
01:44:26,822 --> 01:44:31,384
What did you do with my baby?

1127
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,394
He's with your sister.

1128
01:44:33,462 --> 01:44:35,487
Zaneba?

1129
01:44:39,134 --> 01:44:41,068
Uh...

1130
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:43,070


1131
01:44:53,649 --> 01:44:55,583


1132
01:44:56,785 --> 01:44:59,982
Very clever, Haku. I get it.

1133
01:45:00,055 --> 01:45:02,922
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

1134
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:06,688
So, what do you want?

1135
01:45:06,762 --> 01:45:09,196
Tear up Sen's contract.

1136
01:45:09,264 --> 01:45:13,724
And then I want you to return
Sen and her mother and father
back to the human world.

1137
01:45:13,802 --> 01:45:16,270
Fine, but on one condition.

1138
01:45:16,338 --> 01:45:20,274
<i>I get to give Sen one final test.</i>

1139
01:45:20,342 --> 01:45:22,242
<i>If she fails, she's mine.</i>

1140
01:46:06,188 --> 01:46:09,089
I hope this is the right stop.

1141
01:46:10,225 --> 01:46:12,216
Let's go.

1142
01:46:22,638 --> 01:46:25,368


1143
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,341


1144
01:46:30,646 --> 01:46:32,580


1145
01:46:38,253 --> 01:46:41,051
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

1146
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:50,598
Hmm?

1147
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:53,567


1148
01:47:58,367 --> 01:48:00,301
<i>[Zaneba]</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

1149
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,765
Hello?

1150
01:48:09,111 --> 01:48:11,705
<i>Hurry up. I don't have all day.</i>

1151
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:13,680
Come on.

1152
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:19,416
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

1153
01:48:19,488 --> 01:48:22,889
Sit down. I'll make some tea.

1154
01:48:29,398 --> 01:48:33,129
Excuse me, ma'am. Haku stole this
from you. I came to give it back.

1155
01:48:33,201 --> 01:48:35,863
I see.

1156
01:48:35,937 --> 01:48:38,872
Do you have any idea what this is?

1157
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:42,171
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

1158
01:48:42,244 --> 01:48:46,203
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

1159
01:48:46,281 --> 01:48:50,149
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

1160
01:48:50,218 --> 01:48:53,745
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

1161
01:48:53,822 --> 01:48:57,986
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

1162
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,994
I think I squashed it with my foot.

1163
01:49:00,062 --> 01:49:02,292
Squashed it?

1164
01:49:02,364 --> 01:49:04,628


1165
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,793
That wasn't my slug.

1166
01:49:06,868 --> 01:49:11,066
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

1167
01:49:11,139 --> 01:49:13,972
You squashed it.

1168
01:49:16,044 --> 01:49:18,342
What happened to my spell?

1169
01:49:18,413 --> 01:49:21,143
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

1170
01:49:21,216 --> 01:49:25,949
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

1171
01:49:26,021 --> 01:49:29,115
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

1172
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:32,126
Change back if you want.

1173
01:49:34,196 --> 01:49:36,130


1174
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,691
I don't get along with my sister.

1175
01:49:40,769 --> 01:49:42,930
She's so obnoxious.

1176
01:49:43,004 --> 01:49:45,336
You saw how tacky her home is.

1177
01:49:45,407 --> 01:49:48,467
- We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

1178
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:55,575
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

1179
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:59,017
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

1180
01:49:59,087 --> 01:50:02,147
You'll have to help your parents
and Haku on your own.

1181
01:50:02,224 --> 01:50:04,215
Use what you remember
about them.

1182
01:50:04,292 --> 01:50:07,261
What? Can't you please
give me more of a hint than that?

1183
01:50:07,329 --> 01:50:11,265
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

1184
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:13,267
That's a good start.

1185
01:50:13,335 --> 01:50:17,203
Once you've met someone,
you never really forget them.

1186
01:50:17,272 --> 01:50:20,867
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

1187
01:50:20,942 --> 01:50:24,969
<i>While you're thinking, the boys</i>
<i>and I are going to make you something.</i>

1188
01:50:25,046 --> 01:50:28,243
<i>And I want you</i>
<i>to call me Granny from now on.</i>

1189
01:50:28,316 --> 01:50:31,683


1190
01:50:31,753 --> 01:50:33,846
<i>- Ah, come on. Keep at it.</i>

1191
01:50:36,792 --> 01:50:41,729
No-Face, where did you
learn to spin thread?
You're really good at this.

1192
01:50:41,797 --> 01:50:45,494
<i>Now let's weave</i>
<i>the threads together.</i>

1193
01:50:46,835 --> 01:50:49,565
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

1194
01:50:49,638 --> 01:50:51,572
Knit one... That's right.

1195
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:54,768
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

1196
01:50:54,843 --> 01:50:58,802
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

1197
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,816
My mom and dad could've
been eaten for dinner.

1198
01:51:04,286 --> 01:51:06,720
Wait just a little bit longer.

1199
01:51:06,788 --> 01:51:08,688
Ahh. There we go.

1200
01:51:08,757 --> 01:51:11,590
Use it to tie back your hair.

1201
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:17,664
It's beautiful.

1202
01:51:17,732 --> 01:51:19,859
It'll protect you.

1203
01:51:19,935 --> 01:51:22,768
It's made from the threads
your friends wove together.

1204
01:51:22,838 --> 01:51:24,772
Thank you.

1205
01:51:31,646 --> 01:51:33,580


1206
01:51:33,648 --> 01:51:36,776
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

1207
01:51:36,852 --> 01:51:39,912
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

1208
01:51:45,994 --> 01:51:47,689


1209
01:51:51,633 --> 01:51:56,161
Haku! Haku.

1210
01:51:56,238 --> 01:51:58,536
Thank goodness.

1211
01:51:58,607 --> 01:52:02,202
You're alive! I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

1212
01:52:02,277 --> 01:52:04,211
Ahh.

1213
01:52:04,279 --> 01:52:06,713
That's love for you.

1214
01:52:06,781 --> 01:52:10,080
Look, Granny. Haku's alive.

1215
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:14,110
- Haku, I will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

1216
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:17,625
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

1217
01:52:17,692 --> 01:52:21,253
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

1218
01:52:21,329 --> 01:52:23,661
Come back soon.

1219
01:52:23,732 --> 01:52:26,530
No-Face,
why don't you stay with me?

1220
01:52:26,601 --> 01:52:29,627
- I could use a good helper.

1221
01:52:29,704 --> 01:52:31,638
Granny!

1222
01:52:31,706 --> 01:52:34,436
Thank you so much. I'll miss you.

1223
01:52:34,509 --> 01:52:37,876
Don't worry. You'll be all right, Sen.

1224
01:52:37,946 --> 01:52:41,279
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

1225
01:52:41,349 --> 01:52:43,840
Chihiro. What a pretty name.

1226
01:52:43,919 --> 01:52:46,683
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

1227
01:52:46,755 --> 01:52:49,656
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

1228
01:52:49,724 --> 01:52:54,184
Granny, take care!
Thanks for everything!

1229
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,735
Haku, listen.

1230
01:53:43,812 --> 01:53:47,646
I just remembered something
from a long time ago.
I think it may help you.

1231
01:53:47,716 --> 01:53:51,652
<i>Once, when I was little,</i>
<i>I dropped my shoe into a river.</i>

1232
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:55,212
And when I tried
to get it back, I fell in.

1233
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:58,885
I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

1234
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,554
It finally came back to me.

1235
01:54:01,629 --> 01:54:04,723
The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

1236
01:54:04,799 --> 01:54:08,633
<i>I think that was you,</i>
<i>and your real name is Kalaku River!</i>

1237
01:54:10,672 --> 01:54:12,663


1238
01:54:29,758 --> 01:54:32,318
You did it, Chihiro! I remember.

1239
01:54:32,394 --> 01:54:34,692
I was the spirit of the Kalaku River.

1240
01:54:34,763 --> 01:54:38,392
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kalaku River.

1241
01:54:38,466 --> 01:54:41,162
They filled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

1242
01:54:41,236 --> 01:54:44,034
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

1243
01:54:44,105 --> 01:54:47,734
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

1244
01:54:47,809 --> 01:54:50,972
So you're the one who carried me back
into shallow water.

1245
01:54:51,046 --> 01:54:54,379
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

1246
01:55:28,215 --> 01:55:30,615
- Hey, there they are!

1247
01:55:42,396 --> 01:55:45,957
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

1248
01:55:46,033 --> 01:55:48,331


1249
01:55:48,402 --> 01:55:50,802
- Mama!
- My baby!

1250
01:55:50,871 --> 01:55:55,001
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

1251
01:55:55,075 --> 01:55:58,272
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

1252
01:55:58,345 --> 01:56:00,779
Don't forget your promise.

1253
01:56:00,848 --> 01:56:04,045
You must return Chihiro
and her parents to the human world.

1254
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:07,417
Hmph! Not so fast, Haku.

1255
01:56:07,488 --> 01:56:09,649
I get to give Sen one final test.

1256
01:56:09,723 --> 01:56:12,123
- Shut up!

1257
01:56:12,192 --> 01:56:14,490
Stop it, Mama. Leave her alone.

1258
01:56:14,561 --> 01:56:18,156
- Sen and I had a really good time.

1259
01:56:18,232 --> 01:56:21,133
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

1260
01:56:21,201 --> 01:56:23,396
I have to give Sen one final test.

1261
01:56:23,470 --> 01:56:26,803
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1262
01:56:26,874 --> 01:56:31,277
- But... Granny?
<i>- [Chihiro] Hey, Granny!</i>

1263
01:56:31,345 --> 01:56:33,745
You're right. A deal's a deal.

1264
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:47,355
Okay, I'm ready. I'll take your test.

1265
01:56:47,427 --> 01:56:49,361
Hmm. You've got guts.

1266
01:56:49,429 --> 01:56:52,830
I've got your contract right here.
Come this way.

1267
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:55,835
This'll only take a minute.

1268
01:56:55,903 --> 01:56:58,394
Don't worry.

1269
01:56:58,472 --> 01:57:01,600


1270
01:57:01,675 --> 01:57:05,509
See if you can tell which of these pigs
is your mother and father.

1271
01:57:08,182 --> 01:57:10,116


1272
01:57:14,755 --> 01:57:16,689
You get one try.

1273
01:57:16,757 --> 01:57:19,157
If you get it right,
you can all go home.

1274
01:57:22,229 --> 01:57:24,129


1275
01:57:29,736 --> 01:57:32,500
Huh? There must be a mistake.

1276
01:57:32,573 --> 01:57:34,666
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

1277
01:57:34,741 --> 01:57:38,404
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

1278
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:42,574
- Mm-hmm.

1279
01:57:43,984 --> 01:57:47,112
[All]
Oh, you got it!

1280
01:57:47,187 --> 01:57:49,678


1281
01:57:52,926 --> 01:57:55,087
Thank you, everyone.

1282
01:57:55,162 --> 01:57:58,598
All right, you win.
Get out of my sight.

1283
01:57:58,665 --> 01:58:02,658
Thanks for everything, Granny. Good-bye!

1284
01:58:02,736 --> 01:58:05,671
- [All] Good-bye!
- Thank you!

1285
01:58:05,739 --> 01:58:07,730
- Haku!
- Let's go!

1286
01:58:07,808 --> 01:58:11,005
- Where are my mom and dad?
- When you passed the test...

1287
01:58:11,078 --> 01:58:13,103
they woke up
on the human side of the river.

1288
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:15,614
They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

1289
01:58:15,682 --> 01:58:18,310
There's no water here.

1290
01:58:18,385 --> 01:58:21,616
- I can walk across now.
- But I can't go any farther.

1291
01:58:21,688 --> 01:58:24,054
Just go back the way you came.
You'll be fine.

1292
01:58:24,124 --> 01:58:27,582
But you have to promise not to
look back, not until you've
passed through the tunnel.

1293
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:29,822
What about you? What'll you do?

1294
01:58:29,896 --> 01:58:33,195
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

1295
01:58:33,267 --> 01:58:35,758
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

1296
01:58:35,836 --> 01:58:38,236
I'm fine. I got my name back.

1297
01:58:38,305 --> 01:58:40,796
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

1298
01:58:40,874 --> 01:58:42,808
- Promise?
- Promise.

1299
01:58:42,876 --> 01:58:44,776
Now go, and don't look back.

1300
01:59:07,267 --> 01:59:09,201
<i>- [Mother] Chihiro!</i>

1301
01:59:09,269 --> 01:59:12,204
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

1302
01:59:15,342 --> 01:59:17,572
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

1303
01:59:17,644 --> 01:59:21,341
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.
- You could get in big trouble.

1304
01:59:21,415 --> 01:59:23,781
Are you guys sure you're all right?

1305
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:26,785
<i>[Mother] Let's go.</i>
<i>I don't wanna miss the movers.</i>

1306
01:59:36,863 --> 01:59:39,024
Chihiro, hurry up.

1307
01:59:47,841 --> 01:59:50,537
Everybody, watch your step.

1308
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:53,374
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

1309
02:00:03,457 --> 02:00:05,721


1310
02:00:05,792 --> 02:00:08,386
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

1311
02:00:08,462 --> 02:00:10,396
What is it?

1312
02:00:10,464 --> 02:00:12,398
Look at that.

1313
02:00:14,334 --> 02:00:18,270
- It's all dusty inside too.
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?

1314
02:00:18,338 --> 02:00:21,136
<i>- Looks like it.</i>
<i>- I told you we shouldn't have stopped.</i>

1315
02:00:21,208 --> 02:00:23,233


1316
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:25,301


1317
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:30,743
<i>[Mother] Come on, Chihiro.</i>
<i>Let's get to our new home.</i>

1318
02:00:30,817 --> 02:00:32,808
<i>[Father]</i>
<i>You're not scared, are you?</i>

1319
02:00:32,886 --> 02:00:35,650
<i>Don't be afraid, honey.</i>
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1320
02:00:37,791 --> 02:00:39,725


1321
02:00:49,069 --> 02:00:52,971
<i>[Father] A new home and a new school?</i>
<i>It is a bit scary.</i>

1322
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:55,269
<i>[Chihiro]</i>
<i>I think I can handle it.</i>

1323
02:00:56,039 --> 02:01:15,269
