        <h4>General Rules for w0bm.com</h4>
</div>
<h5>General</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Content on this site is intended for people over the age of 18 only, if you are under 18 get the fuck out right now and don't tell your mom I didn't warn you!</li>
	<li>Leaking of private information is strictly forbidden.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Uploading</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Everything you upload <strong style="color:#1FB2B0;">must</strong> be acceptable with Dutch law</li>
	<li>Absolutely no child pornography in any way! This also includes "modeling" and 3D loli videos. 2D (hentai) is okay.</li>
	<li>Videos that qualify as Nazi videos need to be marked with the nsfw tag an put into the Mett category</li>
	<li>Reposting is not a crime! But in most cases it can be prevented with the use of the <a href="https://w0bm.com/songindex">search form</a>.
	<li>Put your uploads in the correct category, if you have a video that doesn't fit in any of the categories always put it in the Misc category</li.>
	<li>The focus is on videos you can easily watch 200 times a day over and over so upload only catchy shit! For example: <a href="/39">/39</a></li>
	<li>The Artist and Songtitle field is only for the Artist and Song information respectively, anything else in there probably doesn't belong in there, use the Tags.</li>
	<li>The Video Source field is not intended for YouTube Links or any other kind of link, please put only text in there. For example: YouTube and then put the YouTube link in the comments, if you fail at this too often it will probably hurt my vagina and I will scream like a 12 year old princess. Thanks! :3</li>
</ol>

<h5>Tagging</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Tags should always describe the video.</li>
	<li>No links in the Tags, use the comment section for that!</li>
	<li>Always give your video a rating like "sfw" or "nsfw" so people can filter.</li>
	<li>Please don't tag too much shit, thanks.</li>
</ol>
	

<h5>Suggestion for every user</h5>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
	<li>Before you should think about uploading videos to w0bm you should have seen every single video here, we don't want to delete videos because you are too lazy to watch em all! Everytime you repost a ID dies and we don't want that. Like we said it's not a crime but if it happens too often you can expect a ban for not reading and understanding our rules</li>
</ul>
