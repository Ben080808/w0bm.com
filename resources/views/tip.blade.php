<h4>need money to serve memes :(</h4>
<p>Hello good people of the internet!</p>
<p>If you like this project we would be happy if you donate a small amount of money to fill our tip jar and help us to continue with this project!</p>
<p>Our tip goal is not very high so we don't need much money, but it's still good to have some spare money in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>We need <strong>15€</strong> every year to pay for the domain.</p>
<p>If you donate at least 5€ you can have a customized icon behind your name and you support this project and we will love you forever because I will never forget you!</p>
