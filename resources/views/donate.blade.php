<h5>About: ~</h5>
<ul>
<li /><p>First of all we as your webm provider want to be as transparent as possible to you, our so loved user, feel assfucked :3</p>
<li /><p>w0bm is a slut, a traffic slut, a money slut and a slut in general, you know what I mean.</p>
<li /><p>It's getting more difficult to pay the bill with the increasing amount of users, so it's time to reopen donations to collect enough money for the server.</p>
<li /><p>We know that people love shit, thats apparently one reason why people are browsing w0bm but that's not what I mean in first place, I am talking about something little you will get for your donation beside an alive and well doing w0bm</p>
<h6>Rewards:</h6>
<ul>
<li /><p>If you donate 5€ you can choose an icon from <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">fontawesome.io/icons</a></p>

	<p>We accept Bitcoin and PayPal but we highly recommend Bitcoin overall because PayPal wants everytime I make a transaction with my hoster 2,30€ and this is just bullshit, so my advice is Bitcoin.</p>
